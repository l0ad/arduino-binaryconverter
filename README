This is a Eclipse/AVR project used to build a simple BIN/HEX/DEC converter using an Arduino Nano and a TM1638 module.

The project has been built using 
- Eclipse Juno
- ArduinoIDE v1.0.2 toolchain and source files
- AVR eclipse plugin v2.4.0

This project is originally a fork of https://github.com/sebastienjean/arduino-eclipse-simpleproject, so check its wiki for installation/building steps

For any other detail bout the converter, see wiki pages.


Feel free to contact me for any question.
