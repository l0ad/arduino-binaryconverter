Simple BIN/HEX/DEC converter using an Arduino Nano and a TM1638 module.

The project has been built and tested using 

- ArduinoIDE v1.0.4 toolchain and source files

- Eclipse Juno + AVR eclipse plugin v2.4.0

This project is originally a fork of https://github.com/sebastienjean/arduino-eclipse-simpleproject, so check its wiki for Eclipse installation/building steps

For any other detail about the converter, see pages (under construction).


Feel free to contact me for any question.
